# PE_parameter_selection

Python_Package_Name is a Python library for the functions used in "[On the Automatic Parameter Selection for Permutation Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06443)." These functions are used to selection both the embedding dimension and delay for permutations.
The available options are embedding dimension and delay for permutation entropy (and Takens' embedding or state space reconstruction) are shown in the figure below.

## Download

The python script for these functions is provided in this GitHub Repo. In the current state, each method is provided as a seperate function for download.

## Usage

Full documentation, with examples, of the implementation of the functions is provided [here](http://www.firaskhasawneh.com/).
