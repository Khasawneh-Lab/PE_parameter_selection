# PE_parameter_selection

Python_Package_Name is a Python library for the functions used in "[On the Automatic Parameter Selection for Permutation Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06443)." These functions are used to selection both the embedding dimension and delay for permutations.
The available options are embedding dimension and delay for permutation entropy (and Takens' embedding or state space reconstruction) are shown in the figure below.
